- **ReactJS**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **PostgreSQL**: For reliable and scalable database management.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system architecture comprises a robust backend powered by Spring Boot, a dynamic frontend developed using ReactJS, and a PostgreSQL relational database. This architecture ensures scalability, security, and high performance, laying a solid foundation for streamlined blog management and content delivery.

1. **Frontend**: Developed with ReactJS, offering a component-based architecture that facilitates the creation of a dynamic and responsive user interface. The frontend handles user interactions, including blog creation, editing, and commenting.
2. **Backend**: Powered by Java Spring Boot, the backend provides RESTful APIs for handling CRUD operations, user authentication, and authorization. It also manages business logic, ensuring efficient processing of requests.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL is utilized for its robustness and scalability, storing all necessary data including user profiles, blog posts, comments, and multimedia content. The database schema is designed to maintain relational integrity and support efficient data retrieval.
4. **Security**: Implemented using Spring Security, ensuring that user data and interactions are securely managed. This includes user authentication, role-based access control, and protection against common security threats.
5. **File Storage**: Video and image uploads are managed using the filesystem or cloud storage solutions, with references stored in the PostgreSQL database to facilitate efficient retrieval and playback.

By integrating these technologies, the Blog Application delivers a comprehensive platform that supports rich content creation, efficient management, and seamless user interaction, while maintaining high performance and security standards.
